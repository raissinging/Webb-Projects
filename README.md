# The Webb Schools: My Projects  
Projects I did in python for different classes during my time in high school.

## AP Statistics Final Project
Our question is whether or not we can use a linear regression model to predict a Pokemonâ€™s CP based on the sum of its HP, attack, defense, sp attack, sp defense, and speed stats from the original games (a quick estimate to use rather than the actual formula to calcualte CP, which is quite complex). If we find evidence that it is indeed a valid model, this would suggest some utility in using this model to predict what the CPs of Gen 8 Pokemon will be in Pokemon Go. 

## Comparing Text Project
I compared different works to my own writting to see which one was the most similar to mine, writting style wise.

## Movie Picker
Helps you pick between two movies bassed on their Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB score.

## Monty Hall Problem
Parents Day problem for AP Stats: the famous monty hall problem. 
## Dice Rolling
First Lab for physics C; very simple program simulating dice rolls
## 5.1 Problem 26
Carrying out the Lotto game and seeing if it is suprising to not get any matching numbers on the ticket.
