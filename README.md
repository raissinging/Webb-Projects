# The Webb Schools: My Projects  
Random things I do in python for different classes during my time in high school.

## AP Statistics Final Project
Our question is whether or not we can use a linear regression model to predict a Pokemon’s CP based on the sum of its HP, attack, defense, sp attack, sp defense, and speed stats from the original games.  Our population of interest is the Pokemon that are in the game Pokemon Go. Our hypothesis for our test is the following: null—there is no linear correlation between Pokemon stats from the original games and Pokemon CP in Pokemon Go—and alternative—there is a linear correlation between Pokemon stats from the original games and Pokemon CP in Pokemon Go.
