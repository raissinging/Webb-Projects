    Support for Australia’s conservative government has risen to its highest levels in more than six months, a widely watched poll showed on Monday, boosting Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s re-election prospects ahead of a national poll due by May. Morrison’s coalition government now trails the opposition Labor Party by 49 percent to 51 percent on a two-party preferred basis under Australia’s preferential voting system, where votes from minor parties are redistributed, a Fairfax-Ipsos poll showed. The last Fairfax-Ipsos poll in December showed the government trailing by 8 percent. The last Fairfax-Ipsos poll in December showed the government trailing by 8 percent. While still on course for an election defeat, the poll is the best result for Morrison’s government since the ousting of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in August 2018 in a backbench revolt.
